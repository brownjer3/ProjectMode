# Flatiron Project Mode
Flatiron Project Mode is an web application built with Ruby on Rails. The application allows flatiron students to upload details of their previous projects and interact (comment/like) with projects uploaded by other students. Upon registration, users select their cohort from a list of cohorts that have been created by other users in the past. If their cohort does not yet exist, they have the option to create it while registering. 

# Getting Started
Flatiron Project Mode is not yet hosted online. In order to access the application, you'll need to complete the following steps:

* Clone this repo
* Run Bundle Install
* Complete the necessary steps to set up [Google Omniauth](https://github.com/zquestz/omniauth-google-oauth2)
* Add in seed data with the "Rails db:seed" command in the command line to seed the program with demo data

Once you've completed the setup...

* Start the server with 'rails s' in the command line
* Open the server link inside a web browser
* Sign up for an account, making sure to create your cohort if it doesn't yet exist
* Upload your projects!
